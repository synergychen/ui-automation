# UI Automation

Create API to execute OSX events from anywhere.

I have originally designed and implemented it to auto play any android or mac
game (to skip the most time consuming part: level up and farm). By calling
customized API, it will trigger a series of events (mouse click, keystroke, etc.).

## Dependency

- Android simulator (for gaming)
- `Keyboard Maestro`.
